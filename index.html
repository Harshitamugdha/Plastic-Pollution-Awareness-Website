            <h2>Why it matters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Everyday convenience, lasting impact:</strong> Many plastics are used for minutes but persist for decades.</li>
                <li><strong>Microplastics are everywhere:</strong> When plastic breaks down, tiny particles end up in soil, air, and water.</li>
                <li><strong>Communities feel the cost:</strong> Cleanup efforts, health risks, and lost tourism can strain local economies.</li>
            </ul>
