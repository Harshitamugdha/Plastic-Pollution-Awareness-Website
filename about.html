            <h2>What is plastic pollution?</h2>
            <p>Plastic pollution is the buildup of discarded plastic items in the environment. Because most plastics do not biodegrade, they fragment into smaller pieces that remain in water, soil, and the food chain for a long time.</p>
            <p>From cities to remote coastlines, plastic waste can travel through storm drains, rivers, and ocean currents. It collects in local waterways and can also circulate through ocean gyres.</p>

            <h2>Where it comes from</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-use packaging:</strong> Bags, wrappers, bottles, and takeout containers are among the most common items found in cleanups.</li>
                <li><strong>Mismanaged waste:</strong> When disposal systems are overwhelmed, plastic leaks into streets, rivers, and beaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial and shipping losses:</strong> Pellets, fishing gear, and cargo materials can be lost or dumped during transport.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why microplastics matter</h2>
            <p>Microplastics are tiny fragments that result from the breakdown of larger items, tire wear, and synthetic fibers. Because they are small and lightweight, they can spread quickly and are hard to remove once they enter the environment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food chain exposure:</strong> Small organisms consume microplastics, which can move upward through ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Water quality impacts:</strong> Microplastics can absorb pollutants and transport them.</li>
                <li><strong>Human health questions:</strong> Researchers are studying how chronic exposure may affect the body.</li>
